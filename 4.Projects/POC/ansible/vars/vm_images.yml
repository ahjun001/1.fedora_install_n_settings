# vars/vm_images.yml
# Aggregator for per-VM image manifests
# Loads all files from vars/vm_images.d/ and merges them into a unified vm_image_config
#
# Individual VM manifests are in:
#   vars/vm_images.d/f43-kde.yml
#   vars/vm_images.d/f43-kinos.yml
#   vars/vm_images.d/f43-workstation.yml
#
# Each VM file defines a <vm_name>_image_config variable which is merged here.

# Workflow stages reference

  - installed: "OS ready, convert to full image (independent artifact)"
  - provisioned: "Application provisioning (thin clone from installed)"
